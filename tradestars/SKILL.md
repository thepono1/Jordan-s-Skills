## FINANCIAL MODEL (ESTIMATED — NOT VERIFIED)

All figures are Jordan's analysis. Use as frameworks for conversation, NOT as hard facts.

### Revenue Estimate
| Location | Est. Studios | Avg Price/mo | At 75% occ. |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hackney Wick | ~90 | £1,050 | £71k/mo |
| Islington | ~75 | £1,100 | £62k/mo |
| Southwark | ~45 | £2,100 | £71k/mo |
| **Total** | **~210** | **£1,290 avg** | **£202k/mo** |

- **Estimated studio ARR:** ~£2.43M/year ~
- **Ancillary (podcast/photo/meeting rooms, Cloud Shipping):** ~£325-550k/year ~
- **Estimated total revenue: ~£2.75–3.0M/year** ~

### Cost Estimate
- Staff (12-15 FTE × ~£40k + NI): £575-720k/year ~
- Property (rent to Clearbell or mgmt fee): £800k-1.8M/year ~ (biggest unknown)
- Utilities: £150-280k/year ~
- Marketing: £80-180k/year ~
- Tech (OfficeRnD, app, website): £35-55k/year ~

## ROY SHABY — FULL PROFILE

**Title:** Co-Founder & CEO ✅
**LinkedIn:** linkedin.com/in/roy-shaby/ ✅
**Virgin Startup mentor** ✅

### Origin Story
| Fact | Confidence |
|---|---|
| Lost his father at age 11 | ✅ Simon Squibb YouTube interview |
| Lost his mother at age 28 | ✅ Simon Squibb YouTube interview |
| Started with £3,000 and a sushi delivery idea | ✅ multiple interviews |
| Slept in a kitchen for 2 months (early days) | ✅ |
| Spotted sushi gap in Camberwell, South London in 2012 | ⚠️ |
| Virgin Startup £25k grant was first backing | ✅ |
| Built 45 dark kitchens in 18 months | ✅ interview |
| Raised money for FoodStars via 400 investors, 2-year relationship build | ⚠️ |
| Sold FoodStars to Travis Kalanick (March 2019) | ⚠️ |
| Worked with CloudKitchens for ~3 years post-acquisition | ⚠️ |
| Post-exit depression — "most depressing time of my life" (long holiday, nothing to do) | ✅ Yahoo interview direct quote |
| Bought a new laptop on vacation and started Tradestars | ⚠️ |
| Co-founded Tradestars with Michael Bremner | ✅ |

### Personality Framework
- **Relationship-first, transactional-last.** Never pitches cold. 2 years of coffee before asking investors for money. ✅
- **Community is religion.** Built Tradestars because dark kitchens lacked human connection. ✅
- **Respects the grind.** £3k start, sleeping in kitchens, years of rejection. Credentials < demonstrated hustle. ⚠️
- **Simon Squibb alignment.** Active partnership — hosted HelpBnk Accelerator Finale at Tradestars Feb 20 2026. ✅
- **Scale ambition.** Wants more sites, more growth. Not a lifestyle business. ⚠️
- **Brand builder.** Uses TikTok for community storytelling. ✅

## REAL PAIN POINTS

Ranked by urgency:

1. **Occupancy gap (~£75k/month idle)** — 50-70 empty studios at current rate. Clearbell set occupancy targets tied to £60M deployment. ~ urgency HIGH
2. **No tech capability after Charlotte exits** — Technology Director is #OPENTOWORK. Only tech: OfficeRnD white-label with 0 ratings. They have no internal builder. ✅ (Charlotte's LinkedIn status confirmed)
3. **Manual member acquisition** — Ming + Kevin + Julia doing outbound manually. No automated funnel, no SEO machine, no referral program. ~ (inferred from team structure)
4. **App dead on arrival** — 0 ratings after 3 months = members not using it. Retention relying on human relationships alone. ✅
5. **Revenue stuck at one lever (rent)** — No upsells, no partnership referral income, no premium tiers. 250 members × ~£12k/year = ~£3M ceiling. ~

## JORDAN'S VALUE PROPOSITION & PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

### The Three Plays
**Play 1 — Fill the Studios (highest immediate ROI for them)**
- Build automated member acquisition: LinkedIn scraping ideal profiles, n8n outreach automation, SEO for "studio space Hackney Wick" etc.
- Impact: Every 10 studios filled = £155k/year new ARR permanently

**Play 2 — Own the Tech Gap Charlotte Left**
- Build what Charlotte was supposed to: member dashboard, churn prediction model, automated onboarding sequence, AI chatbot for prospects
- Impact: Even retaining 20 members longer = £240k/year at avg £1,000/month

**Play 3 — Unlock Revenue Per Member**
- Partner Tradestars with services members need: insurance, accountancy, e-commerce tools, freight discounts, grant/funding matchmaking
- Impact: Even £50/member/month referral revenue = £150k/year with zero new studios

### Positioning
"You have the community. You have the spaces. You have institutional backing. What you don't have is the system layer — acquisition, retention, and revenue expansion. I build that."

Frame as filling Charlotte's gap. Roy will respond to someone who identified the problem before being asked.

### Pricing Framework
| Package | Deliverable | Price | Their ROI |
|---|---|---|---|
| Studio fill system only | Automated outreach, 10 new members in 90 days | £2,500/mo | 5×+ |
| Full growth retainer | Fill + retention + referral partnerships | £4,500/mo | 3-4× |
| Full buildout | Tech stack, acquisition, retention, revenue expansion | £8,000/mo | 2-3× (compounding) |

### The Irresistible Offer
60-day pilot, no retainer: "If I don't drive at least 8 qualified studio inquiries that convert, we walk away. If I do, we talk about what ongoing looks like."
Mirror Roy's own playbook: 2 years of value before asking for money. He will respect it.

**Post-pilot transition:** £4,500/month + 8% of new member ARR generated for first 12 months = ~£7,000/month once 20 studios filled.

## THE TEAM (LinkedIn-verified, Feb 2026)

| Name | Role | Status | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Roy Shaby | Co-Founder & CEO | Active | ✅ |
| Michael Bremner | Co-Founder | Active (property/ops background) | ✅ |
| Charlotte Kitchman | "Technology Director" | **#OPENTOWORK — leaving.** Real skills: ops/CRM, not engineering. theopswoman.co.uk offline. | ✅ |
| Kiarah Alphonse | Community & Office Manager (Islington) | Active | ✅ |
| Kevin Ralph | Sales / "Helping find perfect co-warehouse space" | Active | ✅ |
| Julia Pichette | Cowarehousing Leasing | Active | ✅ |
| Jake Purkiss | Marketing & Content Creation | Active | ✅ |
| Adam Billingsley | Financial Controller | Active | ✅ |
| Ali Yusuf | Community/Events Manager | Active (runs event calendar) | ⚠️ |
| Carley Cronin | Unknown (mentions Tradestars in bio) | Active | ⚠️ |
| Lucy R. | Unknown (London, no title) | Active | ⚠️ |
| Alice I. | ARB/RIBA Architect | Possibly member or contractor | ❓ |
| Abhiegaile Palha (MCIPS) | Procurement Director | Possibly member or contractor | ❓ |

**Ming Liang** — the person who emailed Jordan:
- Has @tradestars.space email = confirmed employee ✅
- NOT on LinkedIn company people page ✅
- No standalone LinkedIn profile discoverable ✅
- Role: almost certainly **sales / leasing / BD** (outbound prospecting, same function as Kevin Ralph / Julia Pichette) ~
- Strategy: acknowledge the intro, pitch/conversation aimed at Roy

---

## CONTENT & SOCIAL

- **TikTok @tradestars.space:** Member spotlights (ZERO81 Hair Studio), location walkthroughs (Islington), community moments ✅
- **Events calendar:** HelpBnk Accelerator Finale (Feb 20 2026 with Simon Squibb), Pancake Day, London Design Festival (Sep 2025), Christmas Party, Launchpad Preview events ✅

---

## MEETING PLAYBOOK

**Opening:** "Did the Simon Squibb event go well last week?"

**On company:** "The cowarehouse model is interesting — you've basically done what dark kitchens did for food, but for physical product businesses generally."

**On content:** "I noticed you're doing member spotlights on TikTok — is that you or someone on the team driving that?" (opens conversation about team, roles, Ming)

**If asked why you're here:** Lead with value-to-community first, transaction second.

**Avoid:**
- Mentioning Charlotte leaving (you know, not yours to use)
- Leading with 50% sale as a weakness (frame as "I noticed you're making a push to fill Islington")
- Pitching immediately — earn the relationship first

---

## TECH STACK (observed)

- **Website:** WordPress (Project Simply) ✅
- **Member management:** OfficeRnD (white-label app) ✅
- **AI SDR/tracking:** unusual.ai ✅ (found in website code)
- **Original app** (id6499045039) pulled from App Store; replaced by Tradestars London ✅
