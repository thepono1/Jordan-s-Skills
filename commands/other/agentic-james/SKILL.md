# Agentic James - Claude Code & AI Productivity Guide

This skill encapsulates the knowledge from 142 TikTok videos by @agentic.james covering Claude Code, subagents, AI-powered workflows, and productivity techniques.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Be a Producer, Not a Consumer** - Use AI tools to create, not just consume
2. **Leverage AI for Knowledge Work** - Automate repetitive cognitive tasks
3. **Build Agentic Systems** - Create autonomous agents that work for you 24/7
4. **Compound Your Time** - Let AI handle execution while you focus on strategy

## Claude Code Fundamentals

### Subagent Architecture
- Spawn specialized subagents for complex tasks
- Use the Task tool with clear, specific prompts
- Chain agents together for multi-step workflows
- Always provide complete context in agent prompts

### Prompt Engineering for Subagents
- Be explicit about the agent's role and capabilities
- Define clear success criteria
- Specify output format expectations
- Include relevant context from the conversation

### CLAUDE.md Best Practices
- Put project-specific instructions in CLAUDE.md
- Include directory structure and key files
- Document common commands and workflows
- Define coding conventions and preferences

## Key Techniques

### 1. Autonomous Coding Sessions
- Let Claude Code work overnight on complex tasks
- Use detailed prompts with clear objectives
- Review and iterate on AI-generated code
- Trust but verify - always check the output

### 2. Voice-to-Text Workflows
- Use AI voice APIs for mobile productivity
- Dictate tasks and let Claude Code execute
- Build voice-controlled automation pipelines

### 3. Multi-Agent Orchestration
- Create orchestrator agents that coordinate specialists
- Use subagents for research, coding, testing
- Build feedback loops between agents

### 4. Marketing & Lead Generation Automation
- Automate prospecting with Claude Code
- Build personalized outreach at scale
- Create content calendars and schedules

### 5. Knowledge Management
- Use Claude as a second brain
- Build personal knowledge bases
- Automate note-taking and summarization

## Workflow Patterns

### The Producer Mindset
```
1. Identify repetitive knowledge work
2. Document the process
3. Create a Claude Code skill/command
4. Automate and iterate
```

### The Compounding Effect
```
1. Build skills and agents that save time
2. Reinvest saved time into more automation
3. Create leverage through AI assistance
4. Scale your impact without scaling hours
```

### The Agentic Stack
```
1. Claude Code as the orchestrator
2. MCP servers for integrations
3. Subagents for specialized tasks
4. Skills for reusable workflows
```

## Tips & Insights

1. **Start Small** - Automate one thing before building complex systems
2. **Iterate Quickly** - Let Claude Code make mistakes and fix them
3. **Context is King** - Always provide enough context for quality output
4. **Think in Systems** - Build workflows, not one-off solutions
5. **Leverage Compounding** - Small daily improvements lead to massive gains

## Model Selection

- **Claude 4 Sonnet** - Best for coding and complex reasoning
- **Claude 4.5 Sonnet** - Latest model, excellent for agentic work
- **Opus** - For the most complex, high-stakes tasks
- **Haiku** - Fast, cheap, good for simple tasks

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Not providing enough context in prompts
2. Trying to do too much in one agent call
3. Not iterating on failed attempts
4. Being too vague with instructions
5. Not leveraging existing skills and tools
