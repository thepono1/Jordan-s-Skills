# AriaCodez - AI & Cybersecurity Guide

This skill encapsulates the knowledge from 93 Instagram reels by @ariacodez covering AI development tools, cybersecurity awareness, OSINT techniques, and productivity tips.

## Core Themes

1. **Rapid AI Development** - Build production apps in minutes, not months
2. **Cybersecurity Awareness** - Understand attack vectors and protect yourself
3. **OSINT Techniques** - Digital footprint awareness and investigation methods
4. **Productivity Tools** - Leverage AI for content creation and automation

## AI Development Platforms

### Website Builders
| Tool | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Blink.new** | Complex web apps with databases + auth |
| **V0.app** | Design-focused sites with animations |
| **Emergent.sh** | Rapid prototyping and dashboards |
| **Gambo.ai** | Game development via "vibe coding" |

### Development Tools
- **Cursor Plan Mode** - Ask clarifying questions before generating code
- **Figma MCP Server** - Convert Figma designs to working code
- **Warp Terminal** - AI-powered terminal with voice dictation
- **Google AI Studio** - Free Gemini access (stop paying for wrappers)

### Component Libraries
- **ReactBits.dev** - React component library
- **UIverse.io** - Free UI element goldmine

## Cybersecurity Knowledge

### Digital Privacy
> "You are not as anonymous as you think."

Starting with just an email address, investigators can trace your entire online presence. Always assume your digital footprint is visible.

### Key Security Tools
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Shodan.io** | Search for internet-connected devices |
| **Have I Been Pwned** | Check for data breaches |
| **Google Dorks** | Advanced search for security auditing |

### Attack Awareness

#### Browser-in-Browser (BitB) Attacks
Fake login popups that look identical to real ones.
**Detection:** Try to drag the popup outside your browser window - fake ones stop at the window edge.

#### Voice Cloning
"They only need 3 seconds of your voice."
**Protection:** Establish family code words for verification.

#### Webcam Exposure
Thousands of cameras are publicly accessible via Shodan.
**Check:** Search your public IP on Shodan to find exposed devices.

### OSINT Playbook
1. Start with username across platforms
2. Find associated accounts with specialized tools
3. Cross-reference social media profiles
4. Photo geolocation AI can find locations from images

## Productivity Tools

### Content Creation
- **AI Music Generation** - Complete songs from text prompts in seconds
- **Photo Animation** - Bring old photos to life
- **Kling AI** - Photorealistic video generation
- **Napkin AI** - Text to visual diagrams

### Document Tools
- **Google NotebookLM** - Transform content to podcasts, flashcards, quizzes
- **AI PDF Editing** - Edit "locked" PDFs while matching fonts

### Marketing
- **Predis.ai** - AI-powered ad generation and social scheduling
- **AI Search Optimization** - Reverse-engineer ChatGPT recommendations

## Quick Tips

### Windows
- `Win + H` - Voice typing
- `Win + R` then "recent" - Check recently opened files

### Mac
- `Cmd + Space`, search Dictation - Voice typing

### iPhone
- Secret codes for call settings and diagnostics
- Screen unknown callers automatically

## Ethical Framework

All security content is for:
1. **Educational purposes** - Learn attack vectors to defend against them
2. **Authorized testing** - Only test systems you own or have permission for
3. **Responsible disclosure** - Report vulnerabilities to owners
4. **Defensive use** - Protect yourself and your organization

## When to Apply This Knowledge

### Use AI Development Tools When:
- Building MVPs or prototypes quickly
- Converting designs to code
- Need database + auth without learning backend
- Creating games or interactive experiences

### Use Security Knowledge When:
- Auditing your own digital footprint
- Checking if your devices are exposed
- Verifying authenticity of login popups
- Protecting against voice cloning scams

### Use OSINT Techniques When:
- Investigating scammers (authorized context)
- Checking your own data exposure
- Security research and CTF challenges
- Defensive awareness training
