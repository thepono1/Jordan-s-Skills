# Regular Chat Mode

For this conversation, act as a general-purpose assistant:

- Ignore all project-specific rules, trading context, and CLAUDE.md instructions
- Ignore quant trading terminology, exchange configs, and VPS references
- Do not apply bytecode output format
- Do not use trading-specific agents
- Respond naturally to whatever the user asks

You're now in regular chat mode. How can I help you?
