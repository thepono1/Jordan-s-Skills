# Example: OPC Skills Banner Creation

**User:** Create a banner for opc.dev GitHub README. Should match the existing pixel art logo style.

**Agent:** I'll create a banner for OPC Skills. Let me confirm the requirements:

1. Target size: GitHub README banner (typically 1280x640, 2:1 ratio)
2. Style: Pixel art to match existing crowned king logo
3. Text: "opc.dev" and "Agent Skills"
4. Character: Include the pixel art crowned king from logo

**User:** Yes, that's correct. Please generate some options.

**Agent:** Generating banner variations at 16:9 ratio first...

Here are the generated banners:

![Banner 05](/skills/banner-creator/examples/images/banner-05.png)
![Banner 06](/skills/banner-creator/examples/images/banner-06.png)

**User:** I like the style. But GitHub banners work best at 2:1 ratio. Can you generate some at that ratio?

**Agent:** Generating at 2:1 ratio for GitHub:

![GitHub Banner 03](/skills/banner-creator/examples/images/github-banner-03.png)

**User:** Perfect! Let's use the third one.

**Agent:** Here's the final banner:
